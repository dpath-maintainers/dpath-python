    differentiate a list index 0 from a dictionary key '0'.

    Star-star segments are a special case in that they will expand to 0
    or more star segments and the type will be coerced to match that of
    the segment.

    A segment is considered to match a glob if the function
    fnmatch.fnmatchcase returns True. If fnmatchcase returns False or
    throws an exception the result will be False.

    A Word of Caution:

    *** Globs can have different results between Python 2.x and 3.x. ***

    fnmatchcase differs in behavior between Python 2.x and 3.x with
    regard to handling comparison between different types (e.g. bytes
    and unicode). In 2.x it will attempt the comparison implicitly
    converting, but in 3.x it will throw an exception.
