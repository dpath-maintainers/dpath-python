    Merge source into destination. Like dict.update() but performs deep
    merging.

    NOTE: This does not do a deep copy of the source object. Applying merge
    will result in references to src being present in the dst tree. If you do
    not want src to potentially be modified by other changes in dst (e.g. more
    merge calls), then use a deep copy of src.

    NOTE that merge() does NOT copy objects - it REFERENCES. If you merge
    take these two dictionaries:

    >>> a = {'a': [0] }
    >>> b = {'a': [1] }

    ... and you merge them into an empty dictionary, like so:

    >>> d = {}
    >>> dpath.util.merge(d, a)
    >>> dpath.util.merge(d, b)

    ... you might be surprised to find that a['a'] now contains [0, 1].
    This is because merge() says (d['a'] = a['a']), and thus creates a reference.
    This reference is then modified when b is merged, causing both d and
    a to have ['a'][0, 1]. To avoid this, make your own deep copies of source
    objects that you intend to merge. For further notes see
    https://github.com/akesterson/dpath-python/issues/58

          the destination with the source.
        * MERGE_TYPESAFE : When 2 keys at equal levels are of different
          types, raise a TypeError exception. By default, the source
