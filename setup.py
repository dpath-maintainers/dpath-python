        # Type hints are great.
        # Function annotations were added in Python 3.0.
        # Typing module was added in Python 3.5.
        # Variable annotations were added in Python 3.6.
        # Python versions that are >=3.6 are more popular.
        #   (Source: https://github.com/hugovk/pypi-tools/blob/master/README.md)
        #
        # Conclusion: In order to accommodate type hinting support must be limited to Python versions >=3.6.
        # 3.6 was dropped because of EOL and this issue: https://github.com/actions/setup-python/issues/544
